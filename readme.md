I built **NowDraw** in a few hours as an excuse to play around with NowJS [http://nowjs.org](http://nowjs.org). It's a bare-bones collaborative drawing application, complete with two drawing tools: **lines** and **clouds** and a **clear** button. =)  

You can demo the application here: [http://nowdraw.mediaupstream.com](http://nowdraw.mediaupstream.com "NowDraw")
