I built **NowDraw** as an excuse to play around with Node and NowJS [http://nowjs.org](http://nowjs.org). It's a bare-bones collaborative drawing application, complete with two drawing tools: **lines** and **clouds** and a **clear** button. Support for Mobile / iOS included.  

You can demo the application here: [http://draw.mediaupstream.com](http://draw.mediaupstream.com "NowDraw")
