NowDraw - A NodeJS Real-time drawing demo
======

I created **NowDraw** in a couple of hours as an excuse to try out NowJS [http://nowjs.org](http://nowjs.org). It is a bare-bones collaborative drawing application, complete with two drawing tools: **lines** and **clouds** and a **clear** button.  

You can demo the application here: [http://nowdraw.mediaupstream.com](http://nowdraw.mediaupstream.com "NowDraw")  

### Preview

### Installation / Usage  

- Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) installed as well as [NPM](http://npmjs.org/)  
- `cd` into the application directory in your terminal and type `npm install` to install the required dependencies (nowjs, express, ejs)
- After the dependencies install into `node_modules` you can start the application by typing `node draw.js`
- Visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and start drawing (open multiple windows to see the real-time drawing)
